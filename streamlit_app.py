forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).

In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""




img_file_buffer = st.camera_input("Take a picture")

if img_file_buffer is not None:
    # To read image file buffer as a 3D uint8 tensor with TensorFlow:
    bytes_data = img_file_buffer.getvalue()
    img_tensor = tf.io.decode_image(bytes_data, channels=3)

    # Check the type of img_tensor:
    # Should output: <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor'>
    st.write(type(img_tensor))

    # Check the shape of img_tensor:
    # Should output shape: (height, width, channels)
    st.write(img_tensor.shape)
